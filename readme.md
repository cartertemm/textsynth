# Textsynth

This is a python wrapper over [TextSynth](https://bellard.org/textsynth/).

Essentially, it provides randomly chosen text completion backed by GPT-2 and GPT-J transformer based language models. This wrapper exists to facilitate integration in a variety of Python applications.

# Licensing

TextSynth is the work of [Fabrice Bellard](https://bellard.org/). I simply got intrigued by the implications of GPT-2 and other coherent language models. All credit is his.

As far as I'm concerned, this code is unlicensed.
